# martinbour.com
This is the web site application for Martin Bour

# Who is this for?
It's really just for Martin so he can have a web page using GitHub pages and not pay for hosting

# What is it?
It's just a static web application started with a GitHub pages template and running Jekyll

# When was it created?
Started in April of 2015 when Martin decided to shut down his old programming blog that was running on BlogEngine.NET.

# Why is this here?
It's really just for me.  If you are looking at this, I can't think of any real reason why you would want to fork my code, but whatever.
