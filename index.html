    <h3>Developer</h3>
    <p>Currently I am a user interface developer at Philips Healthcare where I am working on new application development using client-side frameworks such as Angular JS and Bootstrap.</p>
    <p>My previous work experience has ranged from building MVC web applications to designing integration solutions using web services.</p>

	<p>This site is being built for free using GitHub Pages, Jekll, Sass, Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, and Refills.  It's progressing slowly, but as time permits I will continue to enhance the site.</p>

    <h3>Musician</h3>
    <p>I have a batchelor's degree in Music Production and Technology from Middle Tennessee State University.  While I don't currently do this for a living I still love music and the creative process of producing musical recordings.  I have a Pro Tools workstation, with some basic plugins.  I prefer natural instrumentation and minimal manipulation of audio signal.</p>

    <p>I also play acoustic guitar and, recently, the banjo.</p>
