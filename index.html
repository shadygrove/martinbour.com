	<aside><p>This is the home page for Martin Bour, a software developer, music lover, and father currently residing near Pittsburgh, PA.  I play guitar and banjo in the band  <a href="http://intothemountainband.com" target="_blank">Into The Mountain</a>.  I also did all the recording, editing and mixing for our album, <a href="http://www.intothemountainband.com/albums/" target="_blank">Dust Restored</a>.</p>

	<p>Yes, I'll admit that there is simply not much here at present.  I hope to work on that in 2017.  Writing is something I actually do enjoy doing, and I hope to use this site to practice this skill and art.</p>

	<p>This is my space on the web.  I plan to use it as such.  The issue there is that I tend to be a man of diverse interests.  This means that you might read a story about my years as a trim carpenter, followed by one about music production techniques, and top it off with a post of some theology books I am reading.</p>

	<p>In order for this site to actually do or become anything it's gonig to have to be me.  I am okay with that and I hope it works for you as well.  Maybe you'll know me better, and who knows, maybe I'll get to know you as well.</p>

	<p>I have set out to keep this site as simple (and cheap) as possible.  It is also important to me to keep all posts in a format that is easy to update and transport between platforms.  Therefore, I am currently using Git Hub pages, which allows for blog posts to be written in Markdown.  For Domain Name registration I use Go Daddy, and for email I am using SoHo's free email service.</p>

	<p>In the end, all I am paying for is the domain name registration via Go Dadday.  Not bad, eh?  Maybe a good starter post will cover how I set all that up.</p>
