<article>

	<aside><p>Welcome! This is web home of Martin Bour.  A software developer by trade, a husband and father by love, a music-lover by joy, and a Christ-follower by faith.</p></aside>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>Bachelor of Science in Recording Industry Production and Technology from Middle Tennessee State University</p>

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>Senior Software Engineer at Philips Healthcare as part of a mid-sized team developing a cloud-based platform for health care products in the areas of sleep apnea.  In particular, they build respiratory devices for sleep apnea patients.</p>

	<h2>A Bit More...</h2>
	<p>In the area of music, Martin plays guitar and banjo in the band  <a href="http://intothemountainband.com" target="_blank">Into The Mountain</a>.  He also does all the recording, editing and mixing for their <a href="http://www.intothemountaband.com/albums/" target="_blank">albums</a>.</p>

	<h3>and...</h3>
	<p>Writing is something I actually do enjoy doing, and I hope to use this site to practice this skill.</p>

	<p>This is my space on the web.  I plan to use it as such.  The issue there is that I tend to be a man of diverse interests.  This means that you might read a story about my years as a trim carpenter, followed by one about music production techniques, and top it off with a post of some theology books I am reading.</p>

	<p>I have set out to keep this site as simple (and cheap) as possible.  It is also important to me to keep all posts in a format that is easy to update and transport between platforms.  Therefore, I am currently using Git Hub pages, which allows for blog posts to be written in Markdown.  For Domain Name registration I use Go Daddy, and for email I am using SoHo's free email service.</p>

	<p>In the end, all I am paying for is the domain name registration via Go Daddy.  Not bad, eh?  Maybe a good starter post will cover how I set all that up.</p>
