title: Martin on... Code

<p>While completing my degree in Music Production I took very entry-level computer science course where we had to build a web page with pure HTML.  It was a hideous single-page site with a florescent green background.  This was back in the early 2000's so the web wasn't nearly as refined as it is today!</p>

<p>After that course, I continued to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript which was the only way to get those cool image roll-over effects.  That was enough to make a little extra cash building small web sites for folks.</p>

<p>Pretty soon customers were asking about dynamic sites with databases and e-commerce systems.  I bought a book on PHP and MySQL and built a couple hand-crafted photo gallery systems.  I also began setting up and customizing e-commerce sites built on open source platforms such as the once-famous osCommerce PHP/MySQL e-commerce platform.</p>

<p>Eventually, this part time work resulted in a full-time programming job doing ASP.NET and Sql Server programming.  As I learned new technologies I took a deeper interest in the fundamental principles of quality software craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Today, I work on a large software team that is building a cloud-based software platform using micro-services written in Java, MongoDB object stores, message queues, AngularJS front-end, and a little bit of NodeJS.</p>

<p>Software development is interesting work, and I enjoy the daily challenge and the software culture that strives daily to do great work.</p>
