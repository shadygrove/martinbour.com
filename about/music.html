title: Martin on... Music

<article>
	<aside><p>I grew up in a musical family.  Music has always been a big part of who I am.  When I was young I loved to play with my father's recording gear, and later went to school to learn professional recording techniques.</p></aside>

	<h2>What I'm Doing Today</h2>
	<p>The acoustic guitar has always primary for me.  In college, I studied classical guitar for a couple years, and this really helped improve my right-hand fingerpicking technique.  Recently, I have taken an interest in flatpicking bluegrass-style guitar, but I'm still learning.  Listening to a lot of Doc Watson lately.</p>

	<p>Also, in recent years I have been dabbling with the 5-string banjo.  I am getting good at faking it on the banjo, but still aspire to play like a real bluegrass pro some day.</p>

	<p>As a trained recording engineer, I do have a recording environment setup at home, and I enjoy working with musicians to capture a quality professional level recording.</p>

	<h2>The Early Years</h2>
	<p>As a young boy, I remember falling asleep on the living room floor listening to my father's band practice in the basement.  At home, we always had a variety of instruments in the house.  Guitars were primary, but we also had an upright piano, drums, and a saxophone.</p>

	<p>My first interest was in the drums, but in high school I began playing guitar more regularly.  Phil Keaggy and Adrian Legg were my earliest guitar influences which got me into playing fingerstyle guitar.</p>
